# Developer Enterprise Platform

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of business unit development, the need for a robust Developer Enterprise Platform has become imperative. This platform addresses the challenges associated with unregulated development practices, fostering a secure and compliant environment for developers. Let's explore the proposal and requirements for implementing such a platform.

## Scenario Overview

In many organizations, business unit developers create applications independently to avoid IT overhead costs. However, this decentralized approach can lead to 'shadow IT,' introducing security and compliance risks. To mitigate these challenges, our proposal focuses on providing a centralized and secure Developer Enterprise Platform.

## The Proposal

### Platform Overview

**Objective**

Develop a platform enabling business unit developers to create, deploy, and run applications within a pre-configured IT infrastructure ensuring security and compliance

**Benefits**
* Centralized governance
* Mitigation of 'shadow IT' risks
* Reduction in development time and costs
* Speed of Development
